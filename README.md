# 3D Engine in C using SDL2

A basic **software 3D engine** written in **C** using **SDL2**, only for educational  purposes. The engine includes core 3D graphics features like projection, transformation, camera movement, triangle rasterization, and basic clipping.

- âœ… OBJ file loading and parsing
- âœ… Perspective projection and 3D to 2D transformation

It's not a good project, i did only for fun and to understand the fundamental of 3d graphics. If you want to contribute, it 
would be a pleasure!
